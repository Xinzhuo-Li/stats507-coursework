## 📘 Course Description

Stats 507 surveys the software tools widely used by data scientists in both academia and industry. The course begins with an accelerated introduction to programming in Python, then transitions into the scientific computing ecosystem:

- **Python fundamentals**
- **NumPy** for vectorized numerical computing  
- **SciPy** for scientific computation  
- **Pandas** for data wrangling and analysis  
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning tools  
- **Git** and high-level debugging workflows  
- **PyTorch** for an introduction to deep learning

The course emphasizes *practical programming skills*, reproducible workflows, and tool proficiency that prepares students for technical interviews and advanced data science work.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as:

- A collection of weekly homework assignments  
- A record of my code, notes, and solutions  
- A personal reference for Python and data analysis techniques  
- A portfolio of my work with the scientific Python ecosystem  

Per course policy, homework is only posted **after due dates** or the repository may be temporarily set to private to maintain academic integrity.
